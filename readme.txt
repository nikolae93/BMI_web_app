About BMI
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely-used method for assessing whether a person is within a healthy weight range. It's calculated by dividing a personâ€™s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The resulting value can help indicate if a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese according to standardized ranges.
